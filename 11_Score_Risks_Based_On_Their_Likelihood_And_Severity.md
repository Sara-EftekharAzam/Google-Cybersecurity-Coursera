## **Notes**

Doing business with other companies might increase the risks to data since it presents additional avenues for information to be compromised. The risk of theft is important but may not be a top priority because the bank is located in an area with low crime rates. Environmental risks such as coastal storms could occasionally disrupt operations but are less frequent compared to digital threats like data leaks or poor encryption.

### **Risk Scoring Guide**

* **Likelihood (1–3):**
  1 = Low likelihood
  2 = Moderate likelihood
  3 = High likelihood

* **Severity (1–3):**
  1 = Low impact
  2 = Moderate impact
  3 = High impact

* **Priority (L × S = Risk):**
  Used to determine how quickly a risk should be addressed.

---

### **Summary**

* **Highest priority risk:** Financial records leak (**Score: 9**)
* **Moderate priority risks:** Compromised user database (**6**) and business email compromise (**4**)
* **Low priority risks:** Theft (**3**) and supply chain disruption (**2**)

These results indicate that the bank should **prioritize securing databases, improving encryption standards, and monitoring access permissions**, while maintaining basic physical and disaster preparedness measures.
