# **Phishing and Malware Reference Guide Prompting Report**

## **Overview**

In this activity, I used the **TCREI prompting framework** (Task, Context, References, Evaluate, Iterate) to generate a high-quality **reference guide** on identifying phishing emails and malware indicators. The process involved starting with a simple prompt and gradually refining it by adding specificity, context, audience details, and formatting preferences.

## **Prompting Process**

### **Step 1: Initial Prompt**

> **Prompt:** “Write a reference guide on phishing emails and malware.”

**Assessment:**
The initial output was accurate but generic. It lacked depth, examples, and a clear focus on the audience. The tone was overly technical, which might confuse non-technical employees.

---

### **Step 2: Adding Context and Audience**

> **Revised Prompt:**
> “As a cybersecurity professional, write a clear and engaging reference guide for non-technical employees on identifying phishing emails and signs of malware.
> Include examples of common phishing tactics (like fake login pages and urgent messages) and a list of signs that a device may be infected with malware.
> Use simple language, bullet points, and short paragraphs to make the content easy to read.”

**Assessment:**
The second output improved clarity and tone. It included helpful examples and a structured layout. However, it still lacked organization by sections and could benefit from more actionable guidance.

### **Step 3: Adding References, Format, and Accessibility**

> **Final Prompt:**
> “Act as a cybersecurity trainer at a large organization. Create a comprehensive, user-friendly reference guide for non-technical employees on detecting phishing emails and malware infections.
> Use the following company cybersecurity guidelines as reference points:
>
> * Always verify sender email addresses.
> * Never click on unexpected attachments or links.
> * Report suspicious emails to IT immediately.
>
> The guide should include:
>
> * Definitions of phishing and malware
> * A list of common phishing tactics (e.g., fake login pages, urgent tone, misspellings)
> * Signs a computer may be infected with malware
> * Preventive steps employees can take
> * A short ‘what to do if you suspect a phishing email’ checklist
>
> Format the guide with headings, bullet points, and placeholders for images (e.g., “Insert image: example phishing email”).
> Use plain, friendly language suitable for all employees, and make it visually clear and easy to scan.”

## **Answers**

### **Question 1: Which parts of the prompting framework did you find most useful?**

✅ **Task (including persona and format)**
✅ **Context**
✅ **References**
✅ **Evaluate**
✅ **Iterate**

All components were useful, but **Context** and **Iterate** were particularly critical for refining the tone and ensuring the guide matched the needs of non-technical users.

### **Question 3: How did evaluating and iterating affect the final output?**

Evaluating and iterating helped refine the tone, structure, and clarity of the output. Each revision made the guide more practical, readable, and aligned with the organization’s real-world needs, resulting in a final version that was both comprehensive and easy for all employees to understand.
