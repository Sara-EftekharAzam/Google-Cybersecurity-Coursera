# **Security Organization Worksheet**

## **Part 1: Describe your security interests**

● **Incident Response and Threat Analysis** – I’m interested in how security professionals detect, analyze, and respond to cyber incidents to minimize damage and prevent future attacks.

● **Cloud Security** – As cloud computing continues to grow, I want to focus on protecting data and workloads in cloud environments like Azure and AWS.

● **Digital Forensics and Investigation** – I’m drawn to forensic techniques used to gather and analyze digital evidence after cyber incidents.

## **Part 2: Identify three organizations and include their mission or objectives**

● **Organization 1: SANS Institute**
The SANS Institute provides cybersecurity training, certifications, and research to promote security awareness and technical excellence. Their mission is to empower professionals to protect organizations from cyber threats.

● **Organization 2: (ISC)² – International Information System Security Certification Consortium**
(ISC)² is a global nonprofit focused on advancing the cybersecurity profession through certifications such as CISSP and educational programs that emphasize best practices and ethics in information security.

● **Organization 3: ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association)**
ISACA offers knowledge, standards, and certifications in IT governance, risk management, and cybersecurity. Its goal is to help professionals ensure trust in information systems.

## **Part 3: Write out which organization aligns with your interests and why**

● **Organization 1: SANS Institute**
Closely aligns with my interests in incident response and digital forensics because it offers practical, hands-on training and certifications (like GCIH and GCFA) that build expertise in these areas.

● **Organization 2: (ISC)²**
Relates to my cloud security interest through its CCSP certification, but its focus is broader on management and governance rather than technical forensics.

● **Organization 3: ISACA**
Supports cybersecurity governance and risk management, but is more suited to audit and compliance professionals than to hands-on incident responders.

**● Best choice for my professional interests:**
**SANS Institute** – It best matches my goals in developing practical, technical skills in incident response and digital forensics while providing excellent opportunities for continuous learning and networking within the cybersecurity community.
