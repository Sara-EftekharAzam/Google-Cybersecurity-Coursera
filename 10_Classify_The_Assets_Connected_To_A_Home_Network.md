## **Summary**

This asset inventory highlights devices connected to the home business network and classifies them according to their sensitivity level. The **network router** and **NAS** require the highest level of protection because they handle critical network connectivity and sensitive business data. The **desktop** also needs protection due to personal and business content stored locally. Devices such as the **smart TV** and **smart home assistant** are less sensitive but still require security measures (e.g., strong passwords and firmware updates) to prevent unauthorized access.
