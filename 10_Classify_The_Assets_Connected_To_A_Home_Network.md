## **Summary**

This asset inventory identifies six devices connected to the home office network. The **network router** and **external hard drive** are the most sensitive, classified as **Confidential**, due to their role in connecting and storing critical data. The **desktop** is **Restricted** because it contains private personal information. Other devices like the **streaming media player**, **portable game console**, and **guest smartphone** are classified as **Internal-only**, as they access the network but pose lower security risk if compromised.

Implementing strong passwords, regular updates, and segmented guest access can help maintain network security and reduce vulnerabilities.
